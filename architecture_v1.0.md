# 🎮 iStudioGamer Architecture v1.0

**Status**: Public Release 1.0  
**Repo**: `iStudioGamer/architecture`

---

## 🎮 Overview

This document defines the foundational architecture of the iStudioGamer platform — a YouTube gaming infrastructure engineered as a product. Built for reproducibility, automation, and performance, it treats videos as immutable assets and infrastructure as versioned code.

## 🧱 Layered Architecture

### 🟦 Metadata Layer

- **Purpose**: Manages video metadata including titles, descriptions, timestamps, hashtags, and SEO structures.  
- **Tech**: YAML / JSON (manual → templated → AI-generated)  
- **Status**: Semi-automated with Whisper + Python  
- **Future**: Full metadata agent, SEO scoring loop

---

### 🟩 Runtime Layer

- **Purpose**: Encodes and processes assets using CLI pipelines  
- **Tech**: FFmpeg (compiled with NVENC + AV1), Whisper, scene parser  
- **Infra**: Raw host-level runtime using native binaries (no containers)  
- **Status**: Working with RTX 4090 + M2 Ultra; parallel execution

---

### 🟥 API/Integration Layer

- **Purpose**: Controls channel assets and video delivery  
- **Tech**: YouTube Data API v3, Google Auth, OAuth2 tokens  
- **Features**:  
  - Resumable uploads of full-length 4K videos via `videos.insert` endpoint  
  - Programmatic updates to video metadata (titles, descriptions, tags) and thumbnails  
  - Extraction of video analytics and generation of performance reports  
- **Status**: Scripts operational using Google API client with proper OAuth 2.0 scopes (`youtube.upload`, `youtube.force-ssl`)

---

### 🟨 DevOps & Automation Layer

- **Purpose**: GitOps-style control of content delivery  
- **Tech**: GitHub Actions, Python CLI, shell orchestration  
- **Future**:  
  - CI/CD for video processing + publishing  
  - Versioned video manifests

---

### 🧠 AI-Augmented Layer

- **Purpose**: Automate content intelligence to accelerate production, optimize metadata, and enable large-scale publishing  
- **Tech**:  
  - Multi-modal LLMs (Whisper + GPT-4o) for transcription, summarization, and semantic parsing  
  - SEO-driven auto-tagging, smart timestamping, and metadata generation  
  - Real-time scene classification and emotion-aware content labeling  
- **Vision**: Build AI-native infrastructure where language models function as autonomous studio agents — executing tasks across planning, post-production, and publishing layers

---

## 🌐 Environments

- **macOS (M2 Ultra)**: 4K GeForce NOW gaming, OBS capture, Resolve editing, GUI control  
- **Linux (RTX 4090)**: Runtime encoding, benchmarking, native Linux gameplay  
- **GCP (optional)**: LLM endpoints for AI pipelines, future CDN integration

---

## 🎯 Purpose and Problem Solved

This architecture was built to solve recurring problems in high-quality gaming content production:

- ❌ Manual, inconsistent metadata across uploads  
- ❌ No structure for managing video assets over time  
- ❌ No automation for 4K benchmarking or performance workflows  
- ❌ No way to treat gaming videos like versioned, reproducible outputs  
- ❌ Fragmented toolchains between macOS, Linux, and cloud workflows

**By versioning the architecture like code, the goals are to:**

- ✅ Enable reproducible pipelines across games, formats, and tools  
- ✅ Treat long-form videos as assets with lifecycle control  
- ✅ Bring DevOps-level clarity to media publishing  
- ✅ Build toward a minimal, intelligent, AI-augmented studio backend
